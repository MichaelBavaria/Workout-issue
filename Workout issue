Hi, I am on Version 3.5 1810. Found a new issue by creating a new workout. I am not able to save this workout, created with the editor.
I am always getting the info, "The file is already existint". GC is always giving a name "0" to the file and I am not albe to store it.
Is this known? How can I work arount?

Thank you
Michael
